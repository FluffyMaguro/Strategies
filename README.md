ISSUES:
- look at the provided solution, see how it satisfies requirement of indifference

- getting negative values sometimes 
Does that mean that there doesn't exists a mixed strategy where P1 mixes all A-S-G
But perhaps there is a mixed strategy for just two: AS, SG, or AG

- if I increase greedy vs standard effectivness, greedy chance goes down
